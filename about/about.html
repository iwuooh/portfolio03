          <h1>THE ART OF<br>CIDER</h1>
          <p>TASMANIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE <span>DIFFERENT</span>.AND SO HAS PAGAN CIDER – PRODUCERS OF TASMANIAN PREMIUM CRAFT CIDER. WE’RE A SMALL BOUTIQUE CIDER PRODUCER, <span>BUBBLING WITH FRESH IDEAS.</span></p>
          <button class="common_btn m_type b_type"><a href="../our/our.html">view more</a></button>
          <h3>1. TAKING A FRESH APPROACH</h3>
          <p>We use the tastiest fruit, fresh from the tree, lovingly grown in the Huon Valley by fourth-generation orchardists using earth-friendly farming practices. Whole crisp, juicy apples and seasonal fruits such as plump luscious cherries and fragrant quinces are pressed with care, then transformed by pure alchemy — using modern cidermaking wizardry — into ciders of rare sparkle, clarity and balance.</p>
          <h3>2. FRUIT, FRUIT AND NOTHING BUT THE FRUIT</h3>
          <p>Pagan Cider is a ‘whole-fruit’ cider. This means we only use real, whole fruit to make our cider. As you would expect. Sadly, not all ciders are made using this pure and time-honoured approach. Many mass-market ciders contain NO FRUIT AT ALL — they are simply alcoholic carbonated cordials, flavoured with fruit juice concentrate (often imported), and are distinguished by their sugary sweetness and ‘chemical’ aftertaste.</p>
          <h3>3. NO ADDED SUGARS, EVER</h3>
          <p>Unlike most ciders, Pagan Cider is made without adding sugar, at any stage of production. Because we use tasty fruit and modern cidermaking expertise, we simply don’t need to balance our ciders with sugar. All you’ll taste in our refreshing ciders is the natural lushness of real Tasmanian fruit.</p>
          <h3>4. CONSISTENT QUALITY IN EVERY BATCH</h3>
          <p>A recurring issue with rustic farmhouse ciders made using traditional methods is that these can vary wildly in flavour from batch to batch — a characteristic which can be endearing, but more often disappointing. Not so with Pagan Cider. Our fruit comes from the same orchard every time, and our cidermakers carefully control the crushing, fermenting and blending process across each and every small batch, eliminating unwanted oxidisation of our juice and ensuring a consistently fine result.</p>
